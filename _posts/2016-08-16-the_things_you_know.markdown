I once heard the great bass player Victor Wooen describe  4 levels of mastery. Stage one is 'not knowing what you don't know,' for example enthusiasitically playing air guitar without worrying about what is required to play the song on the real thing. Next is 'knowing what you don't know.' After beginning actual study, you begin to realize how much there is to learn. It is overwhelming to be at step one realizing how far there is to go. Next, is 'knowing what you know.' You have learned a lot, and are aware of the various things that you know how to do. The is the highest level that most musicians would hope to achieve. The final level of mastery is 'not knowing what you know.' An analogy to this is the level of mastery most people have in speaking their native tongue--you don't think about what words or phrases you know, rather whenever you need to communicate something, the words just come out instinctively. Musical masters exhibit this same level of mastery in the instrument they play, musical passages come out as instinctively as words when they are required.

With respect to development, I am solidly in level two at the moment. Since starting to work on the Rails, I realized the universe of things that I am not competent in and it is very overwhelming. For the exercises involving learning the basics of ruby, each lab would have just a few moving parts and it was pretty smooth sailing. Now, for the rails/javascript labs there are a ton of moving parts. 

I don't think complete mastery of programming is possible in the way it is for playing guitar, as technologies are constantly changing and evolving. Still, my goal is to one day be competent enough to through together the framework of an app without getting overwhemled by each detail.
