For a long time when I thought about programming it filled me with regret. I wished I had studied it in school and was jealous of those who had identified their interest earlier and were able to. I felt like the opportunity had passed. The feeling was only enhanced by the fact that I tried a few MOOC programming classes and even after fully completing them, felt no closer to developing real world skills. In the last year, however, I decided to make one final attempt to get over the hump. I had the summer nearly completely off following law school graduation in May and starting work in September (except for studying for the Bar exam..) and I realized that this would likely be my best chance in the near future to learn a new skill.

I choose the Learn verified program and set my goal to finish before I started work 9/12. Here we are on 9/15... I finished! Well almost, I didn't write this final blog post until 9/15. But I learned ruby, rails, js, and angular in the last 3 months. Of course everything you learn makes you aware of 10 more things that you do not know at all. But for the first time I feel like I have broken through. I feel like I have advanced to the point where I can continue to learn on my own. I'm hoping to pick up some freelance opportunities in the near term see what happens..
